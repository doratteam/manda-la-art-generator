#Manda-la-art-generator


### What is a mandala art? 

- Manda la art is a technique developed by a Japanese designer. It helps you to brainstorm an idea, by forcing you to generate 8 different ways to achieve something, and then again thinking about 8 different ways to achieve each of those ways. 

- We made this so that you can easily set your goal and think about how you might achieve that goal.
