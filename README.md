### What is a mandal art? 

- Mandal art is a technique developed by a Japanese designer. It helps you to brainstorm an idea, by forcing you to generate 8 different ways to achieve something, and then again thinking about 8 different ways to achieve each of those ways. 

- We made this so that you can easily set your goal and think about how you might achieve that goal. 

### How do I use this thing? 

- To begin, you should fill in your most important goal in the middle grid. (i.e.To become the best hacker in town)

- Then think about 8 things you need to do to achieve this goal. (i.e. Study JavaScript, Master computer architecture, Learn how to code C like a boss, etc.) 

- Click "Continue", and it will take you through the 8 things you need to do to achieve that goal. Now think about 8 different ways you might achieve each of them. 

- When you're done, click "Download".
